**CLASS DETAILS**

*Class*

In today’s class, we explored the fascinating world of Python and Machine Learning. Our focus was on a project that really brings these concepts to life—a hand gesture recognizer. As part of their Green Belt curriculum, the students chose this as one of their two sub-projects for their final sprint project. It's an exciting way to see how Python can be used in real-world applications.

*Lab*

The lab was all about turning theory into practice. We followed a detailed coding tutorial, with hands-on guidance from me, to start building the hand gesture recognizer. It's impressive to see how quickly the students are picking up these advanced concepts. With the help of the tutorial and some step-by-step instructions, they were able to make significant progress on their project. By the end of the session, they had a working sample Python file and an output image showcasing their accomplishment.
